# FRONT-END PROJECT
<h1>🏠 SmartSense Dashboard</h1>
In this project I have made a modern, interactive Smart Home Monitoring Dashboard built with React and bootstrap of my vision/concept. This Simulates live IoT sensors, system alerts, and user-controlled settings in a clean, professional layout. 
<h2>🚀 Features</h2>

🌡️ **Real-Time Dashboard** – Live sensor updates (temperature, humidity, energy).

📊 **Reports & Analytics** – Energy usage trends and visualizations.

🧠 **Sensors Diagnostics** – Displays CO₂, voltage, battery, and status per room. 

🔔 **Smart Alerts** – Auto-generated alerts + activity logs that appear one-by-one. (Using made up Data)

⚙️ **Settings Page** – Global temperature toggle (°C/°F), alert sound, device management.

💬 **Alert Banner System** – Top-right notifications for system events (offline sensor, high temp, etc.).

🧭 **Persistent Sidebar** – Smooth navigation without page reloads.

======================

<h2>🧠 What I Personally Learned</h2>

* Building a multi-page layout with React component structure. Breaking many UIs into components, easier to manage

* Using React hooks like useEffect for data simulation and real-time updates. As if the IoT is picking up data
  
* Created global settings (isCelsius) that updates all pages in sync

* Managing global app state for shared settings (like temperature units)

* Implementing animation to live updates professional and functional

* Integrating Bootstrap + Animate.css + Recharts for fast visual UI design

<h2>⚙️ Tech Stack</h2>

* React (with Vite)

* Bootstrap 5

* Animate.css

* Recharts.js

* JavaScript (ES6+)

* HTML + CSS

<h3>💡 Inspiration</h3>

This project was built as a personal learning and a portfolio showcase of the potential I have to front end works — inspired by the real Smart Homes devcies and dashboards that automate, monitor, and control appliances in a home


❗️**TEMPORARY MESSAGE:** this project is still under development❗️


There will be some minor changes and features yet to be added, I will continue to work on this project since i feel like theres still more to add and fix. I will keep updating this repository, or maybe you can fork this and drop some of your ideas if anyone reads this! 😁 


<h3>Future Improvements 🔜</h3>

* 🌙 Add full Dark Mode toggle.

* 🔋 Simulate changing battery levels.

* 📶 Add real API integration for IoT sensors.

* 📱 Improve mobile responsiveness.

* 🎵 Enable real alert sounds for high-priority events.
