🏠 SmartSense Dashboard (FRONT-END PROJECT)
In this project I have made a modern, interactive Smart Home Monitoring Dashboard built with React and bootstrap of my vision/concept . This Simulates live IoT sensors, system alerts, and user-controlled settings in a clean, professional layout. 

🚀 Features

🌡️ Real-Time Dashboard – Live sensor updates (temperature, humidity, energy).

📊 Reports & Analytics – Energy usage trends and visualizations.

🧠 Sensors Diagnostics – Displays CO₂, voltage, battery, and status per room. 

🔔 Smart Alerts – Auto-generated alerts + activity logs that appear one-by-one. (Using made up Data)

⚙️ Settings Page – Global temperature toggle (°C/°F), alert sound, device management.

💬 Alert Banner System – Top-right notifications for system events (offline sensor, high temp, etc.).

🧭 Persistent Sidebar – Smooth navigation without page reloads.

🧠 What I Personally Learned

Building a multi-page layout with React component structure. Breaking many UIs into components, easier to manage 

Using React hooks like useEffect for data simulation and real-time updates. As if the IoT is picking up data 

Created global settings (isCelsius) that updates all pages in sync 

Managing global app state for shared settings (like temperature units). 

Implementing animation to live updates professional and functional.

Integrating Bootstrap + Animate.css + Recharts for fast visual UI design.

⚙️ Tech Stack

React (with Vite)

Bootstrap 5

Animate.css

Recharts

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML + CSS

💡 Inspiration

This project was built as a personal learning and portfolio showcase — inspired by the real Smart Homes devcies and dashboards that automate, monitor, and control applicens in a home

**this project is still under development**

There will be some minor changes and features yet to be added, I will continue to work on this project and will try to complete my vision 


🧩 Future Improvements:

🌙 Add full Dark Mode toggle.

🔋 Simulate changing battery levels.

📶 Add real API integration for IoT sensors.

📱 Improve mobile responsiveness.

🎵 Enable real alert sounds for high-priority events.
